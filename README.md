# Week 3

Defining the Environment
Environment is a situation in which an agent is present or surrounded by.
we will be creating an environment object, which will act as interface such that when we
invoke
sim(agent,env);



# Week 4

In this lab we explored MDP with a Q Learning Agent
MDP is Markov Decision Process
According to Markov property, the current state of the robot depends only on its immediate previous state and not the rest of the past steps
A Markov process is defined by (S, P) where S are the states (sequence of random states) and P is the state-transition probability (probability of going to some other state from current state)
Markov Decision Process is defined by (S, A, P, R, gamma) , A is the set of actions, S is the set of states, P is the state-transition probability, R is the reward and gamma is some discount factor.
MDP is a discrete time stochastic control process, models decision making where outcomes are partly random and partly under the control of the decision maker.
